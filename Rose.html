                A rose is a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa, in the family Rosaceae, or the flower it bears.<br>
                </br>There are over three hundred species and thousands of cultivars.<br>
                They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles.<br>
                Flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds.<br>
                Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa.<br>
                Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant.<br>
                Roses have acquired cultural significance in many societies. Rose plants range in size from compact, miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height.<br>
                Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.<br>
